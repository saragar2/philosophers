<br><h4>Philosophers is a project done for 42 School, where we must solve the very known "dining philosophers problem", by Edsger Dijkstra.
<br>There is an specified amount of philosophers around a table with a bowl full of spagheti. The issue appears when they realize they need two forks to eat them, so they must take a fork from their partners.
